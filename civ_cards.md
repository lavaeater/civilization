# Civilization Cards

The way purchases of civilization cards work is as follows:

1. The player is presented with all available civilization cards, grouped by type.
2. Any cards already owned are marked as such.
3. Any cards that have a prerequisite that the player does not own are marked as such.
4. The cost of the cards are marked as original cost / the cost given the credits the player has from other civilization cards.
5. The player selects any number of cards to purchase up to the total value of their  commodity cards on hand and any tokens in treasury (not yet implemented).
6. When the player is ready to purchase, they are then presented with a view to select the combination of commodity cards and treasury tokens to use to purchase the selected cards.
7. The player selects the combination of commodity cards and treasury tokens to use to purchase the selected cards.
8. The cards are purchased and added to the player's civilization cards.
9. The player is marked as done when it comes to purchasing cards.
10. When all players are done, the game moves to the next activity.
